# GoBrik Web App
An open source application serving ecobrickers around the world and their efforts to keep plastic out of the biosphere.

We're just launching the development of GoBrik on Github.  We're starting with the CSS and main HTML page for the app.  The CSS needs lots of work cleaning up and refining.  Currently our core CSS is here, while the rest is on Knack.  We're slowly moving all our CSS here.

We use the Knack.com database development platform for GoBrik.  Slow and steady our goal is to transition off of knack onto full code development on GitHub.

Our development team uses a mattermost server to work. Join here:  https://gea.mandala.team/signup_user_complete/?id=q6tiqrm1wbrtbccochsiayf64y
