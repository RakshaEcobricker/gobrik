# Welcome to the development of GoBrik!

GoBrik is a social action platform based on ecobricking.  The app is developed and maintain by the Global Ecobrick Alliance Earth Enterprise (non-company, non-profit) to serve the global plastic transition and ecobricking movements. Launched in 2017, GoBrik now connects 40,000 users and 5,000 communities from 120 countries through their ecobricking.  The platform provides users and communities with the tools to log, track, exchange and manage their ecobricking.  The core of the platform is our community powered ecobrick authentication system which generates our brikcoin manual blockchain.  

GoBrik is currently in beta-- as we prepare all of our core assets for open source development here in on GitHub and prepare the launch of Android and iOS apps.  The majority of GoBrik is currently based on the Knack.com development platform, which has been used by our core development team to lay out the concept, vision, and database structure of GoBrik.

We're just launching the development of GoBrik on Github.  We're starting with the CSS and main HTML page for the app.  The CSS needs lots of work cleaning up and refining.  Currently our core CSS is here, while the rest is on Knack.  We're slowly moving all our CSS here.
